        <p>I have been waiting for a low power computer to stick in an old console to relive the 1980's in all of it's 8 bit glory. My objective was to make the case appear relatively stock
          but I have made some exceptions. I also wanted the unit to function in a reasonable way via the power, reset and joypad only. I had started the project thinking I would have to
          do most of the programming myself beyond the libretro implementation I was going to use but fortunately there are some really great projects out there already doing this. 
          RetroArch, RetroPi, EmulationStation and RetroPie-Setup to bring it all together. I am hoping to contribute to all of them now that I'm at the software part of my plans but they've all worked so well
          thus far that I haven't had much need.</p>
